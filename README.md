"The Hundred" is a lively and entertaining dice game that combines luck and strategy. The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach a certain point total, typically 100, by accumulating points through dice rolls.

In "The Hundred" each player takes turns rolling a single six-sided die. On their turn, a player repeatedly rolls the die until they either choose to "hold" and bank their accumulated points or roll a "1." If a player rolls a "1," their turn ends, and they lose all the points accumulated during that turn. However, if the player decides to hold before rolling a "1," their turn ends, and the points they accumulated during that turn are added to their overall score.

With its simple rules and element of chance, "The Hundred" offers an exciting and fast-paced gaming experience suitable for players of all ages. It encourages probability assessment, decision-making skills, and a bit of luck, making it an enjoyable game for gatherings, parties, or casual gaming sessions.
